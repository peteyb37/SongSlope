# SongSlope
Are you a music subscription user?  Do you (like me) have over 100 playlists that you actively create and catalogue?  If the answer is yes and you want to  share those  playlists with people  across other platforms, then this project is for you!   SongSlope is a website where you can easily export your playlists to one central location and share them with friends!  Anyone on your friends list can then import the playlists into their own streaming service  of choice, or at the very least, view the playlists in one location for free!
